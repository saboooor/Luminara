# Luminara SMP Rules

#### Please note that the staff may have full discretion over all rules and their enforcement.

#### Voice/Private chat is typically unmoderated, if a user is being obnoxious in a voice/private chat, they may be muted.

##### Last updated Aug 18, 2025

## 1. Grief

Claimed structures may not be griefed.

Griefing is only allowed if builds are unclaimed.

Keeping your build unclaimed indicates that you have no issue with other players griefing your build, although it may be reverted if asked.

Intentionally lagging the server is not allowed.

## 2. Sensitivity

If a player is uncomfortable about a topic and asks you to stop, you must stop or move to a private chat, no questions asked.

This rule only applies to sensitive topics that may make others literally uncomfortable.

## 3. Hate Speech

Anything that is recognized as a slur are all forbidden.

Hate speech towards any individual(s) is not tolerated, this is a friendly server, not a place for hate.

## 4. Impersonation

Impersonating Staff (A.K.A. Acting like you're staff) or players is not permitted.

This includes mini-modding (Moderating chat as a player).

Mini-modding may also be sometimes taken as a form of toxicity.

## 5. Building

Building inside a 100 block radius outside of a player's build without permission is not recommended as the owner of that build may request to move your build by contacting the staff.

On a second note, you can also contact the staff if you would like to move your build to a better looking area.

## 6. Spam

Keep spam to a minimum. This includes pinging people repetitively on Discord.

Flooding the chat with pointless content (ex. copypasta) to an irritating point is not allowed.

## 7. Cheating

X-raying, hacking, duping, or exploiting bugs and glitches are not allowed.

## 8. Advertisements

You may not talk about other servers unless they're well-known by minecraft players worldwide. (ex. hypixel, hive, etc.)

## 9. Annoyances

If a player is bothered or annoyed by what you're doing that's related to them, you must stop.

Repetitively trolling (e.g. telling people to do "alt + f4" to make people leave) is not permitted.

## 10. Behaviour

If a player is uncomfortable with controversial/sensitive topics, move your conversation to a private chat (As stated in Rule 2.).

Toxicity is not tolerated.

Some examples of toxicity include but are not limited to:

- Directing swears towards others.

- Insulting others in a discrete repetitive way.

- Acting like you're above everyone else. (At Luminara SMP, everyone is equally treated.)

- Any type of harassment.

## 11. Privacy

Leaking others' most likely private information is not permitted.

Some people may see privacy in a different way than you would, please respect it.

(IP, age, location, phone numbers, etc) (Doxxing)

## 12. Inclusivity

You may not disrespect/discriminate others. Everyone in Luminara SMP are included regardless of sexuality, race, looks, etc.

Discrimination towards any group that may be against your views is not permitted. That includes but is not limited to people with different sexualities, races, looks, etc.

Religion is not an excuse as you still must respect others.

Any form of discrimination is not permitted.

Discriminating against others because of their race / ethnicity / sexuality / looks will not be tolerated as we are a welcoming and inclusive community.

## 13. Plugin Rules

You may not pressure people into turning off /nosleep. They may keep the night for any reason.

Abusing the Jobs plugin or any other plugin that earns you money is not allowed.

You may not use an alt for an economic advantage (For example: Jobs)
